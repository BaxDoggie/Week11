“Reproducibility is a minimum necessary condition for a finding to be believable and informative” (Marwick, Is archaeology a science? Insights and imperatives from 10,000 articles and a year of reproducibility reviews, 2025, p. 6). 

This quote felt like the heart of this week’s work because it explained why we were doing replication instead of just reading about it. Working through the Loiselle replication made the idea of “believable and informative” feel more tangible. A fail for me during this process was struggling with packages not installing properly, which slowed everything down a bit. At the same time, my biggest win was successfully getting it all working and replicating the analysis, which showed me firsthand that the patterns Marwick and Loiselle reported actually held up when I did the work myself. That experience made the idea of reproducibility feel earned rather than assumed. 

This project also made me think differently about what this means for history as a field, especially compared to archaeology. It feels obvious why archaeologists should make their data open because their work often depends on measurements, material remains, and large datasets. For history, it feels less straightforward at first, but it starts to make sense when thinking about how much data historians actually create, like transcriptions, digital archives, curated source sets, and coding of themes in documents. If historians moved toward reproducibility in a similar way, education would have to change so that students are taught not just how to argue, but how to document their research process clearly enough that someone else could follow it. That would mean treating research steps as part of the final product, not just the polished narrative. 

This also connects strongly to public facing work. If historians and archaeologists made their processes open, the public could see how conclusions are built, not just what the conclusions are. Digital projects could let people explore primary sources themselves instead of only seeing curated stories. That kind of transparency could help build trust, especially when people are skeptical about experts or academic authority. It also makes collaboration more possible, because communities could engage directly with the evidence instead of being passive audiences. 

Overall, this week showed me that reproducibility is not just a technical issue, it is an ethical and educational one. Even though fighting with broken packages was frustrating, being able to successfully replicate the analysis made the conclusions feel much stronger. It made research feel more real and more accountable. Thinking about how these practices could extend into history makes it clear that reproducibility could change how knowledge is created, taught, and shared, and that matters far beyond just one assignment.
